# Adafruit Python BluetoothLE

Python library to simplify access to Bluetooth low energy devices and services on Linux (using bluez) and Mac OSX (using CoreBluetooth).

This library provides a Python wrapper for BLE **Central Mode**, meaning it can initiate connections and data exchanges with other BLE Peripherals.  It does not allow you to emulate a BLE Peripheral via Python, or provide Python-based access to BLE peripherals connected to your system.
